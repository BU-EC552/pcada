# Mock Company Data

This folder contains CSVs, each of which correspond to different configuration/construction parameters related to
DNA synthesis using the Repp tool.  Five "companies" were created, simulating potential DNA assembly companies where
a research team could order synthesized DNA parts.  To incorporate these files in the PCADA application, move them
out of this folder into the file where the main application is executed.
