# Config Outputs

These are sample configuration files generated as a result of using the config_manager.py and the company_server.py
files.  In actual deployment, the configuration files would be populated with data retrieved using actual company APIs,
but fundamentally, the structure of the file would remain the same.  The template is directly based on a configuration 
file used in the existing Repp software.  Many fields in the configuration file are not used; this is a point of 
concern of the Repp tool, and should be improved upon in future iterations of the PCADA/Repp applications.
