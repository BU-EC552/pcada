# Expected Output

These files represent the expected output from the existing As0 example used to test the Repp platform.  The JSONs are
exact output from the Repp tool; the PNGs are the result of the visualizer tool plotting the constructed DNA sequence.
Note that some of the designs are different, depending on the construction and cost parameters retrieved from the
various mock companies.
